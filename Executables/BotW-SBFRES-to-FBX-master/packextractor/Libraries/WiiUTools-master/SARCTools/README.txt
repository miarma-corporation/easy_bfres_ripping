Made these for extracting and packing SARC files. If you run into SZS files, that's Yaz0 compressed SARC, this should extract them too. You'll need to use yaz0enc to repack (which you can find here: http://www.amnoid.de/gc/yaz0enc.zip), and keep in mind padding. If you encounter SZS files, chances are that it uses a specific padding value (usually like 0x2000 or 8192), and the compressed SARC also has that value at 0x8 in the Yaz0. Be sure to add it or else bad things. You can specify a (decimal) padding value as a third value in SARCPack.
