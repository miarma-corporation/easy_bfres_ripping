So I've noticed that a large problem with FBX files is the fact that they fail to encompass the models from 3DSMax correctly.  Considering that having the correct models is kinda sorta definitely important, I'm trying to switch to OBJ files instead, which supposedly are the standard for some different model sites and do show the correct models.  OBJ files also seem to recognize bones as little yellow pyramids, however, which is really weird and doesn't seem fixable through the standard menu.  Offline so I'll look that up at some point.
